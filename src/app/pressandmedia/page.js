          <p className="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
            In just under two weeks since the fire at 3925 Kingsway Avenue, Seville Investments has already completed
            renovations on four of the ten affected units. All repaired spaces have undergone comprehensive updates,
            including new flooring, cabinetry, and fire-resistant materials.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-300">
            With relocation support still underway, competition for restored units has surged. Leasing inquiries have
            increased across multiple platforms, and Seville has received strong interest from both displaced tenants
            and new applicants.

          <p className="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
            On July 22nd, emergency crews responded to a significant fire at one of Seville Investments properties
            located at 3925 Kingsway Avenue. The fire, which began on the third floor, caused extensive damage to ten
            residential units before it was contained. Residents were safely evacuated and no injuries were reported.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-300">
            Vancouver Police have now identified and charged a suspect in connection with the arson. The investigation
            remains ongoing, with further charges pending. The local community has rallied around the displaced
            residents, many of whom are long-term tenants of the building.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-300 mt-3">
            Seville Investments expressed gratitude to emergency responders and reassured tenants that long-term
            restoration plans were already underway. The company has committed to both structural and amenity upgrades
            as part of the post-incident recovery.
